This guide will help you navigate and use the MLR3 Spatial Prediction Tool effectively.

## Getting Started

### Data Requirements

#### Raster Files
- Format: GeoTIFF (.tif)
- All rasters should have the same:
  - Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
  - Extent
  - Resolution
- Each raster represents one predictor variable

#### CSV File
- Must contain:
  - Coordinates (X/Y or Longitude/Latitude)
  - Response variable (the value you want to predict)
- Coordinates should be in the same CRS as the raster files
- No missing values in coordinate or response columns

### Example Data Format

**CSV File:**
```
X,Y,Yield,Field_ID
-56.78901,34.56789,4.5,1
-56.78902,34.56788,5.2,1
-56.78903,34.56787,4.8,1
...
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Upload Data

1. Click "Browse..." next to "Upload Predictor Rasters (.tif)"
   - Select one or more GeoTIFF files
   - You can select multiple files at once

2. Click "Browse..." next to "Upload Response & Coordinates (.csv)"
   - Select your CSV file with response data and coordinates

3. Select the appropriate columns:
   - X Coordinate Column (e.g., "X", "Longitude")
   - Y Coordinate Column (e.g., "Y", "Latitude")
   - Response Variable Column (the variable you want to predict)

### 2. Configure Model

1. Select a model type:
   - **Random Forest (Ranger)**: Good general-purpose model, handles non-linear relationships
   - **Gradient Boosting (GBM)**: Often provides high accuracy, may require more tuning

2. Set the training data proportion:
   - Higher values (e.g., 0.8) use more data for training
   - Lower values (e.g., 0.6) reserve more data for testing
   - Recommended: 0.7-0.8

3. (Optional) Enable Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Check "Enable Hyperparameter Tuning"
   - Set the number of tuning evaluations (more evaluations = better results but slower)
   - Tuning uses random search with 3-fold cross-validation

### 3. Set Prediction Settings

1. Adjust the raster resolution:
   - Lower values = higher resolution, more detailed but slower
   - Higher values = lower resolution, less detailed but faster
   - Choose based on your analysis needs and computational resources

2. Click "Train Model" to start the model training process

### 4. Explore Results

After model training completes, explore the results in the tabs:

#### Data Preview
- View the first few rows of your CSV data
- See a list of loaded raster files
- View a map of your response variable

#### Model Training & Results
- View performance metrics (RMSE, RÂ², MAE)
- See a plot of predicted vs. observed values

#### Feature Importance
- View a bar chart of variable importance
- Identify which predictors have the strongest influence on your model

#### Model Validation
- View cross-validation results
- Assess model stability across different data subsets

### 5. Generate Prediction

1. Go to the "Raster Prediction" tab
2. (Optional) Apply a mask:
   - Check "Apply Mask"
   - Upload a mask file (.geojson or .gpkg)
   - This restricts prediction to the area within the mask

3. Click "Generate Prediction" to create the prediction raster
4. View the prediction map
5. Click "Download Prediction" to save the result as a GeoTIFF file

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Better Results

1. **Data Quality**:
   - Remove outliers from your response data
   - Ensure coordinates are accurate
   - Use predictors that are likely to influence your response variable

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Try both model types to see which performs better
   - Random Forest is often more robust with less tuning
   - GBM may achieve higher accuracy with proper tuning

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Always enable tuning for final models
   - Use at least 10 evaluations for better results
   - Be patient - tuning takes time but improves results

4. **Validation**:
   - Check the cross-validation results to ensure model stability
   - Look for consistent performance across folds
   - Large variations between folds may indicate overfitting

### Troubleshooting

1. **Slow Performance**:
   - Reduce raster resolution
   - Use fewer predictor rasters
   - Disable tuning for initial tests

2. **Error Messages**:
   - "Error loading raster(s)": Check that raster files are valid GeoTIFFs
   - "Error loading CSV": Ensure CSV format is correct
   - "Coordinate columns must be numeric": Check for non-numeric values in coordinate columns

3. **Poor Model Performance**:
   - Try different predictors
   - Enable hyperparameter tuning
   - Check for outliers in your data
   - Consider data transformations (e.g., log transform skewed variables)

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Mask Files

You can create custom mask files to restrict predictions to specific areas:
- Use GIS software (QGIS, ArcGIS) to create polygon shapefiles
- Save as .geojson or .gpkg format
- Upload as mask when generating predictions

### Resolution Considerations

- Match the prediction resolution to your analysis needs:
  - Finer resolution (10-30m) for detailed local analysis
  - Coarser resolution (50-200m) for regional analysis or when using many predictors
- Higher resolution increases processing time and file size
