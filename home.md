# Welcome to the MLR3 Spatial Prediction Tool

This application allows you to perform spatial machine learning and prediction using the powerful mlr3 framework in R.

## What You Can Do

- **Upload spatial data** (rasters and CSV files)
- **Train machine learning models** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- **Evaluate model performance** with various metrics
- **Generate spatial predictions** with adjustable resolution
- **Visualize results** with interactive plots and maps

## Getting Started

1. Use the sidebar panels to upload your data
2. Configure your model settings
3. Train your model
4. Explore the results in the tabs
5. Generate spatial predictions

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [User Guide](user-guide.qmd) or the [Technical Documentation](technical-docs.qmd) for more advanced information.

## About This Project

This application is built on the [mlr3 framework](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/), a modern machine learning framework for R. It provides a user-friendly interface for spatial prediction tasks that would otherwise require extensive coding.
