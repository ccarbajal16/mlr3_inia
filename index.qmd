## Project Overview

This is a Shiny application for machine learning with R using the mlr3 framework. The app allows users to upload spatial data (rasters and CSV files), train machine learning models, and generate spatial predictions.

### Key Features

- Upload and process spatial data (rasters and CSV files)
- Train machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Configure model parameters and hyperparameter tuning
- Generate spatial predictions with adjustable resolution
- Visualize results with interactive plots and maps

## Project Structure

### Main Files

- **app.R** - The main Shiny application file containing both UI and server logic

### Directories

- **www/** - Contains static assets for the web application
  - INIA_LOGO.png - Logo image used in the app header


## Application Features

### Data Input

- Upload predictor raster files (.tif)
- Upload response & coordinates data (.csv)
- Select coordinate columns and response variable

### Model Configuration

- Choose between Random Forest (Ranger) and Gradient Boosting (GBM) models
- Set training/test split ratio
- Optional hyperparameter tuning

### Prediction Settings

- Adjust raster resolution for predictions
- Apply optional mask for predictions
- Download prediction results

### Results Visualization

- Data preview with map of response variable
- Model performance metrics
- Predicted vs. observed plots
- Feature importance visualization
- Cross-validation results
- Raster prediction maps

## Dependencies

The application uses the following R packages:

- shiny, shinythemes - For the web application framework
- terra, sf - For spatial data handling
- ranger, gbm - For machine learning algorithms
- data.table - For efficient data manipulation
- mlr3, mlr3learners, mlr3spatiotempcv, mlr3pipelines, mlr3extralearners, mlr3tuning - For machine learning framework
- paradox - For hyperparameter space definition
- ggplot2, tidyterra, viridis - For visualization

## UI Design

The application uses a custom theme with INIA green colors and a responsive layout with sidebar and main panel sections.
