## About the Project

The MLR3 App is a Shiny application designed to make spatial machine learning accessible to users without extensive programming knowledge. It leverages the powerful [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/) machine learning framework for R, combined with spatial data handling capabilities.

## Purpose

This application was developed to:

- Simplify the process of applying machine learning to spatial data
- Provide an intuitive interface for model training and evaluation
- Enable spatial prediction generation without writing code
- Visualize results in an informative and interactive way

## Development

The application was developed using R and Shiny, with a focus on:

- User-friendly interface
- Efficient handling of spatial data
- Robust machine learning implementation
- Clear visualization of results
